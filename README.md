# LiveClocks

My first hands on experience dealing with Elixir LiveView, which is a basic app that demostrates a GenServer getting times every 500 milliseconds for each timezone, and then a LiveView instance which fetches those times and in realtime sends them to a users browser to demonstrate the ability for realtime development in an easy way with Elixir.
